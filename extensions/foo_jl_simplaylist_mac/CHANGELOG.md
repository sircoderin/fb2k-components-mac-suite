# Changelog

All notable changes to SimPlaylist will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Album art and group column misaligned with Group Header Spacing**: Group height calculation used track row height for all rows instead of accounting for taller header rows. Album art and group column backgrounds now use correct pixel height via `pixelHeightForGroup:` helper. Also fixed album art vertical offset to use header height for styles 0/1.
- **View jumps on auto-advance**: Scrolling no longer jumps dozens/hundreds of tracks back when a new track plays automatically in a long playlist. Metadata updates during playback no longer trigger a full rebuild. Also added scroll preservation in sync detection background continuation.
- **Enter key plays focused track**: Pressing Enter now correctly starts playback of the keyboard-focused track. Previously broken due to passing a playlist index where a row index was expected, and was restricted to flat mode only.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- **Group Header Spacing setting**: Adjustable vertical spacing for group header rows
  - Compact: Same height as track rows, text centered
  - Normal: Slightly taller (+6px) for breathing room
  - Larger: Generous spacing (+12px) for visual separation

### Fixed
- **Glass background toggle**: No longer requires restart to take effect
- **Subgroup headers in style 3**: Now display before their tracks (was appearing after)
- **Memory safety**: Replaced unsafe `__weak` pointers in C++ containers with `NSHashTable`
- **Cache memory pressure**: Formatted values cache now has bounded size with proper eviction
- **Path traversal**: Playlist name sanitization prevents directory escape

### Performance
- **Album art cache**: Batch LRU eviction reduces lock contention during rapid scrolling
- **Subgroup iteration**: O(log n) binary search replaces O(n) linear scan

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed
- **Orphaned custom columns**: Renaming a custom column no longer causes it to become unmanageable
- Custom column renames now sync to visible columns list
- Orphaned columns (visible but without definition) are automatically cleaned up on startup

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Glass background option**: Transparent background using NSVisualEffectView (requires restart)
- **Custom Columns**: New preferences page (Display > SimPlaylist > Custom Columns) for user-defined columns with name, alignment, and title formatting pattern
- **Column menu overhaul**: Flat list of built-in columns, SDK columns from components, and custom columns sections
- **Shared UIStyles component**: Centralized styling for consistent look across components

### Changed
- Refactored to use shared UIStyles.h for colors and fonts
- Glass mode respects macOS accessibility setting (reduce transparency)
- "Edit Custom Columns..." menu item opens dedicated preferences page
- Playback statistics (Play Count, First/Last Played, etc.) now sourced from SDK only

### Fixed
- Album art blinking during fast scrolling (increased cache limits, always show placeholder while loading)

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-11

### Changed
- Removed "Solid" option from Header Accent (too similar to selection color)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **Header Size setting**: Compact (22px) / Normal (28px) / Large (34px)
- **Header Accent setting**: None / Tinted - use system accent color for column header
- **URL drop support**: Accept URL drops from external sources (e.g., Cloud Browser)

### Changed
- Column header styling matches default foobar2000 playlist
- Focus ring uses system accent color (matches selection)

## [1.1.7] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **Threading crash**: Selection sync now dispatches SDK calls on main queue (was causing autolayout crashes when default playlist view was also active)
- **Vertical text centering**: Track text now properly centered within row height

### Added
- **Row Size setting**: New preference to adjust row height and font size
  - Compact: 12pt font, 19px row
  - Normal: 13pt font, 22px row (default)
  - Large: 14pt font, 26px row
- **'#' column in column menu**: Track number column can now be toggled on/off via right-click header menu

### Changed
- Removed duplicate "Track no" column (use "#" instead)
- Existing "Track no" columns automatically filtered out on load

## [1.1.6] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Context menu crash on foobar2000 2.26+**: Removed dead code that incorrectly bridged C++ pointer as ObjC object, causing crash when Cocoa called retain on it

### Technical
- Bug only affected fb2k 2.26+ users (contextmenu_manager_v2 API)
- See docs/DEBUG_REPORT_2026-01-03_context_menu_crash.md for full analysis

## [1.1.5] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Option-key modifier for drag operations**: Hold Option to copy instead of move
  - Same playlist: Option+drag duplicates items
  - Cross playlist: Option+drag copies items (leaves source unchanged)
  - Default behavior (no modifier) moves items

## [1.1.4] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed
- **Cross-playlist drag support**: Drag data now captures file paths at drag start - if active playlist changes mid-drag (e.g., spring-loaded folder preview), items are correctly moved to the new playlist (inserted and removed from source)
- **Cross-playlist drag with cloud files**: Now correctly handles non-local paths (mac-volume://, mixcloud://, etc.) by passing foobar2000 native paths directly
- **Multi-item drag not working**: Clicking on an already-selected item in a multi-selection no longer reduces selection to single item - all selected items are now dragged together
- **Folder drop file ordering**: Files from dropped folders are now sorted by path before inserting, ensuring correct track order
- **Focus not set on dropped items**: Focus ring now moves to first inserted item after external file drop
- **Delete focus behavior**: Cursor now moves to next item after delete (or previous if at end)
- **Focus ring appearing during drag**: No longer shows focus outline on random items while dragging
- **Focus ring appearing after drag**: Suppressed for 100ms after drag operation ends
- **Drop indicator jumping erratically**: Uses pure distance-based positioning at album boundaries
- **Items misplaced after drag to padding area**: Dragging to end-of-album padding now correctly places items at end instead of beginning
- **UI blink when deleting items**: Disabled Core Animation during playlist rebuild

### Technical
- Drag pasteboard now includes dictionary with sourcePlaylist, indices, and paths (Plorg updated for compatibility)

## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-30

### Fixed
- **Delete tracks not working**: Delete key now correctly removes selected tracks
- **Drag and drop reordering not working**: Internal track reordering now works properly
- **External file drop not working**: Dropping files from Finder now inserts at correct position

### Technical
- Sparse model stores playlist indices directly in selection, not row indices
- Removed dead node-based code paths that were silently failing

## [1.1.2] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **Excessive spacing in style 4 (header under album art)**: Reduced gap between album groups by half

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **Album art blinking during rapid scrolling**: Cache eviction no longer causes placeholder flicker

### Changed
- Increased album art cache from 200 to 500 images
- Batch image load completions with 50ms delay for smoother redraw

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-28

### Added
- **Header Display Styles**: Four configurable header display modes
  - "Above tracks" (default) - Header row appears above track rows
  - "Album art aligned" - Header text aligned with album art left edge
  - "Inline" - Header row with album art starting at same Y position
  - "Under album art" - No header row, text drawn below album art
- **Subgroup Support**: Display disc numbers (Disc 1, Disc 2, etc.) within album groups
  - Configurable subgroup pattern (e.g., `[Disc %discnumber%]`)
  - "Show First Subgroup Header" option
  - "Hide subgroups if only one in album" option
- **Now Playing Highlight**: Optional yellow shading for currently playing track
- **Dim Parentheses Text**: Option to render text in `()` and `[]` with dimmed color
- **Preferences UI**: Reorganized into two sections
  - Grouping Settings (Preset, Header Pattern, Subgroup Pattern, Show First Subgroup, Hide Single Subgroup)
  - Display Settings (Header Display, Album Art Size, Now Playing Shading, Dim Parentheses)

### Fixed
- **Hidden tracks at end of multi-disc albums**: Tracks at the end of albums with disc subgroups were incorrectly classified as padding rows and not rendered
- **Subgroup detection showing disc headers mid-album**: Albums with inconsistent discnumber metadata no longer show spurious headers
- **Settings change losing scroll position**: Uses synchronous detection when scroll position exists
- **Extra padding for multi-subgroup albums**: Padding formula now subtracts subgroup count
- Header text now vertically centered in header rows (was bottom-aligned)
- Album art column no longer clips header text

### Changed
- **Performance**: O(1) caching for subgroup row lookups (was O(S) per lookup)
- **Performance**: Debounced text field changes (0.5s delay) to avoid rebuild on every keystroke
- **Performance**: Lightweight redraw for visual-only settings (Dim Parentheses, Now Playing Shading)
- Refactored subgroup detection into unified SubgroupDetector helper struct
- Install script clears macOS extended attributes to help invalidate dyld cache
