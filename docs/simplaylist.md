# SimPlaylist

A streamlined playlist view with album grouping and cover art display for foobar2000 macOS.

### Album Grouping with Cover Art

### Header Display Styles

Three configurable header display modes to match your preference:

| Style | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Above tracks** | Header row appears above track rows with separator line |
| **Album art aligned** | Header text starts at left edge, aligned with album art |
| **Inline** | Compact header style with smaller text, no separator line |

### Now Playing Highlight

Optional yellow shading highlights the currently playing track, making it easy to spot in large playlists.
