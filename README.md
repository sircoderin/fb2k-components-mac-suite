# foobar2000 macOS Components

A collection of macOS components for foobar2000 v2 – mostly remakes of the components, which I used to love back then on windows.

DISCLAIMER: All of this is a WIP, actively tested on my foobar2000 instance, but WIP nonetheless, it may crash your foobar.

| ![SimPlaylist Overview](docs/images/simplaylist-overview.png) | ![SimPlaylist Settings](docs/images/simplaylist-settings.png) |

**Features:**

### Playlist Organizer

Tree-based playlist management with folder organization and smart import. Necesity to manage playlists more managable. No nice screenshots of hyper-organized playlists yet, they are scattered, but there are some import tools to import either from old windows thheme.fth or from Strawberry, which became an alternative for a time being.

| Overview | Import Menu |

**Features:**
- Hierarchical folder organization
- Drag-and-drop playlist reordering
- Smart import from filesystem with path mapping
- Autoplaylist support
- Playlist search and filtering

### Waveform Seekbar

Audio visualization seekbar with real-time waveform display and visual effects. This one was my favorite, a neat way to navigate through tracks.

| Overview | Settings |
|----------|----------|
| ![Waveform Seekbar](docs/images/waveform-overview.png) | ![Waveform Settings](docs/images/waveform-settings.png) |

**Features:**

- Multiple display modes (bars, lines, filled)
- Customizable colors and effects
- Click-to-seek functionality
- Downmix/channel selection

---

### Album Art (Extended)

Extended album art viewer with support for multiple artwork types and selection-based display. Unlike the built-in album art element, this one can show back covers, disc art, and more.

**Features:**
- Display front, back, disc, icon, or artist artwork
- Shows artwork for selected track (falls back to now playing)
- Right-click context menu to switch artwork type
- Navigation arrows on hover to cycle through available types
- Per-instance configuration (each panel remembers its type)
- Layout parameters for default artwork type

**Layout Usage:**
```
albumart_ext                    # Front cover (default)
albumart_ext type=back          # Back cover
albumart_ext type=disc          # Disc art

# Dual panel layout (front + back side by side)
splitter horizontal
  albumart_ext type=front
  albumart_ext type=back
```

---

### Queue Manager

Visual playback queue manager - functionality that exists in Windows foobar2000 but was missing on macOS. See all queued tracks and manage playback order.

<!-- Screenshot: Queue Manager -->

**Features:**
- Visual queue display with configurable columns
- Drag & drop reordering within queue
- Live updates when queue changes
- Double-click to play, Delete to remove
- Context menu (Play, Remove, Clear, Show in Playlist)

---

### Last.fm Scrobbler

Last.fm integration for scrobbling and now-playing updates. An absolute necesity for us, who celebrated 20 years of last.fm scrobbling this year.

![Last.fm Scrobbler Settings](docs/images/scrobbler-settings.png)

**Features:**
- Automatic track scrobbling after 50% or 4 minutes
- Now Playing notifications
- Browser-based Last.fm authentication
- Offline queue with automatic retry

## Author

Hi there, I'm a random long-term foobar2000 enjoyer, who had to migrate to MacOS a few years back and have been waiting for some movement on the components field for quite some time. Now after some experience with Claude I put together what was necessary for it to start building the tools which I loved so much when I used foobar on windows.

If you like this project, you can support it here.

## Layout Editor

To add these components to your layout, use **View → Layout → Enable Layout Editing Mode**, then right-click to add UI elements.

### Component Names for Layout

Use these names in the layout editor or when editing the layout text file directly:

| Component | Recommended | Also Accepted |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| SimPlaylist | `simplaylist` | `SimPlaylist`, `foo_jl_simplaylist`, `jl_simplaylist` |
| Playlist Organizer | `plorg` | `playlist-organizer`, `foo_jl_plorg`, `jl_plorg` |
| Waveform Seekbar | `waveform-seekbar` | `waveform_seekbar`, `foo_jl_wave_seekbar`, `jl_wave_seekbar` |
| Album Art (Extended) | `albumart_ext` | `album_art_ext`, `albumart-ext`, `foo_jl_album_art`, `jl_album_art` |
| Queue Manager | `Queue Manager` | `queue_manager`, `QueueManager`, `Queue`, `foo_jl_queue_manager` |

### Example Layout

Here's a complete layout configuration featuring all three UI components:

```
splitter horizontal style=thin
  waveform-seekbar
  splitter vertical style=thin
    splitter horizontal style=thin
      plorg tab-name="Playlists"
    splitter horizontal style=thin
      simplaylist
    splitter horizontal style=thin
      tabs
        splitter horizontal style=thin tab-name="Now Playing"
          albumart
          selection-properties sections=metadata
        audiounit mode=visualization name=AUGraphicEQ vendor=Apple tab-name="EQ"
      playback-controls
```

This creates a layout with:
- Waveform seekbar at the top
- Playlist Organizer on the left sidebar
- SimPlaylist as the main playlist view
- Tabbed panel with Now Playing info and EQ visualization
- Playback controls at the bottom
