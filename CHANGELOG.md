## SimPlaylist

### [1.4.3] - 2026-03-24

#### Fixed
- **Space key**: Now toggles play/pause instead of track selection; starts playback when stopped.
- **Scroll rendering**: Tracks no longer appear blank when scrolling to albums outside the initial viewport.
- **Import sort order**: Tracks sorted by metadata (album artist, album, track number) instead of filename.

#### Added
- Drag tracks from SimPlaylist to Finder to copy files out (preference toggle for move-by-default)
